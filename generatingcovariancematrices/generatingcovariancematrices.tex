\section{Generating Covariance Matrices}

This section contains information on how to generate covariance matrices for a given systematic uncertainty both locally.

\subsection{Locally}

In order to generate a covariance matrix locally, a single fhicl file can be run \footnote{I'd recommend copying this to your \lstinline{/nova/ana/users/${USER}} area and running from there.},\\
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
cmf_covariancematrixmakerjob.fcl
\end{lstlisting}
\footnote{Ensure you're using the CMF version of this file. Another version, \lstinline{covariancematrixmakerjob.fcl} exists, but is related to the FNEX framework and is not what you should be running.
}

Inside this fhicl file, there are three options that a user should configure:\\
\begin{lstlisting}
TREEFILE	: Path to EventList file. For now these are located in /nova/ana/users/brebel/skimmed
SYSTPAR		: Systematic parameter to vary
NITER		: Number of iterations of the systematic to run (i.e. number of universes)
\end{lstlisting}

The options for which systematics you can choose can be found in \lstinline{CMF_SystematicParameters.fcl}

Once these substitutions have been made, a covariance matrix can be generated with the following command

\begin{lstlisting}
art -c cmf_covariancematrixmakerjob.fcl
\end{lstlisting}
