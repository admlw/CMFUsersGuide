\begin{lstlisting}
core 		: the core classes that CMF is built on: EventLists, VarVals, ShifterAndWeighter
data		: contains root files for calibration systematic uncertainties
dataProducts: data products and structs commonly used in CMF analysis
fhicl		: contains all fhicl files
macros 		: useful .C files
modules 	: art modules and plugins which are run with fhicl files
scripts 	: scripts for, i.e. submitting to the grid

\end{lstlisting}
